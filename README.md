# iCUE Remover
A clean way to automatically remove Corsair's iCUE software.

_This has been tested with iCUE 4.x and 5.x on Windows 11._

Recently replaced my K70 LUX RGB with a K70 RGB MK.2 and found that iCUE did not appreciate the hardware change. Every time I locked Windows I would get an error from iCUE that my keyboard had a problem with the onboard memory. After a three weeks of having to unplug and reconnect my keyboard USBs, I decided I had enough of it. I found that Corsair doesn't offer an uninstaller, but rather a lengthy list of instructions specifying which files and folders should be deleted. Knowing I might have to do this again in the future for other hardware replacements/upgrades, I thought I should just script it.
